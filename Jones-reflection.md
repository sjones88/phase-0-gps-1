### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was a little confused about merge conflicts.

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I gained a better understanding of how merge conflicts are created and resolved.

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my guide to confirm that the 'git pull' command is equivalent to running 'git fetch' and 'git merge.'

### What still confuses you about git?
Some of the language in GitSCM's explanation of branching is a bit confusing.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I actually didn't work with a pair during this GPS. I 'paired' with a guide and did all of the driving.
